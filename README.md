# Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Quora Question Pairs

This project aims to solve a binary classification problem to predict whether or not a provided pair of questions submitted to Quora have the same or similar meaning through the use of natural language processing. By determining whether or not the question pairs are duplicates, we can improve the experience in finding high quality answers for Quora writers, seekers, and readers by providing a single page for questions with a similar intent.

This project is based on a Kaggle competition hosted by Quora. You can find more details about the problem and download the dataset by visiting the competition at <https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs/>.
